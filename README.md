# Overview

# User Experience (UX)

## Strategy

### User stories

**First Time Visitor Goals**

1.  As a first time visitor, I want to be able to quickly and easily identify what the main purpose of the website is.
2.  As a first time visitor, I want to be able to navigate through the website easily, to read content and view photos that I am interested in.
3.  As a first time visitor, I want to view high-quality images, to get a good sense of the places referenced in the journals.

**Returning Visitor Goals**

1.  As a returning visitor, I want to read detailed travel journal content to learn about the different areas of Scotland to get some ideas for my own travels.
2.  As a returning visitor, I want a way to get in contact with the owner with any comments or questions I may have.
3.  As a returning visitor, I want to engage with a community of like-minded people on social media.

**Frequent User Goals**

1.  As a frequent user, I want to read more detailed information on travel locations, including distances to different places of interest and recommended or required travel gear that can be used as inspiration for my own adventures.

### Design

**Colour Scheme**

The colour palette consists of four colours: dark blue, light blue, turquoise, and white. This colour palette was inspired by [The Scottish Higlands colour palette by The Colour Palette Company](https://thecolourpalettecompany.com/collections/the-scottish-highlands-colour-palette), with some minor adaptations to help meet accessibility requirements.

**Typography**

- [Metamorphous](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Metamorphous) is used as the display font for large heading styles (H1 & H2). This font is inspired by Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance letter shapes, and was used to help convey the blend between historical landmarks and nature content throughout the website. A serif font has been set as a fallback, which will replace Metamorphous if there are any issues with the font loading correctly for any reason.
- [Monstserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) is used as the font for the body copy and other heading sizes. This font is a good pairing with the larger display heading font used, as they have a similar x-height, and makes for easy reading of longer passages of content. A sans serif font has been set as a fallback to replace Monsterrat, in any case where there are issues with this loading correctly.

**Imagery**

- The imagery used throughout the site is important to help immerse the user in the content. All photos are entirely my own, and were taken on trips to Scotland, in order to provide an authentic and realistic experience. Ther is one exception of an image used in the featured journal article (Inveruglass II), which was taken from [cottages.com](https://www.cottages.com/cottages/kintulloch-uk5230), and it's use has also been credited on the website.
